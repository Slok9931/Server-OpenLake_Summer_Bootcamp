# Task 1: Basic Node.js & Express Server

This is a simple Node.js project created to explain the basic setup of an Express.js web server. This task has the initial requirements of setting up a project, creating a server, defining basic routes, and using `nodemon` for development.

## Features

- **Node.js Initialization**: The project is set up with a `package.json` file.
- **Express Server**: A lightweight server is created using the Express.js framework.
- **Basic Routing**: Includes two example routes:
    - `/` (Home page)
    - `/about` (About page)
- **Development Workflow**: Uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when file changes are detected, improving development speed.
