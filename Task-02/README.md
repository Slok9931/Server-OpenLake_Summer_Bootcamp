# Server-OpenLake_Summer_Bootcamp

Welcome to the **Backend Bootcamp with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**!  
This repository is designed for mentees to learn full-fledged backend development by building hands-on projects, one step at a time.

Each mentee will have their own folder (named after themselves) where they will complete and commit all their tasks.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this bootcamp, you'll be able to:

- Set up a Node.js server
- Create APIs using Express.js
- Understand RESTful routing
- Work with MongoDB (CRUD operations)
- Use Postman for API testing
- Implement Authentication and Authorisation using JWT
- Connect backend to frontend (basic integration)
- Structure a backend project using MVC architecture
  
---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each mentee must create a folder using their **full name** (in lowercase and separated by hyphens). For example:
slok-tulsyan/

Each task should be inside its own subfolder with clear naming (e.g., `task-01`, `task-02`), and should include:

- `index.js` (entry point)
- `package.json`
- `.env` file (if required, do NOT push sensitive data)
- A `README.md` inside each task folder explaining what you've done
